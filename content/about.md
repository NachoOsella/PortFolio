# About Me

Hi, I'm **Nacho** — a passionate full-stack developer with a strong focus on building scalable, maintainable, and user-centric applications.

## My Journey

I started my programming journey with Java and quickly fell in love with the elegance of well-architected systems. Over the years, I've expanded my toolkit to include modern web technologies like **TypeScript**, **Angular**, and **NestJS**, allowing me to craft end-to-end solutions that deliver exceptional user experiences.

## What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Backend Development**: Building robust APIs and microservices with Java (Spring Boot) and Node.js (NestJS)
- **Frontend Development**: Creating responsive, interactive UIs with Angular and modern CSS
- **System Architecture**: Designing scalable systems using microservices patterns, API gateways, and clean architecture principles
- **DevOps**: Containerizing applications with Docker and managing deployments on Linux servers

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Java, TypeScript, SQL
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, NestJS, JPA/Hibernate
- **Frontend**: Angular, RxJS, Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Linux (Arch)
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Current Focus

I'm currently deepening my expertise in:

- Advanced Angular patterns (signals, standalone components)
- Microservices architecture and distributed systems
- Cloud-native development and container orchestration

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Exploring new Linux distributions and customizing my development environment
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Learning about system design and software architecture patterns
- Enjoying the vibrant tech community
