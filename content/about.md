# About

I build backend systems. The kind that survive traffic spikes, handle edge cases gracefully, and don't wake anyone up at 3am.

## Background

I started with Java and stayed close to the server ever since. Over the years I've moved across the stack — Spring Boot microservices, NestJS APIs, Angular frontends — but my instinct is always the same: design the data model first, get the contracts right, then build outward.

## What I Work On

- **Backend systems** — REST APIs, service-to-service communication, data pipelines, auth flows
- **Architecture** — Microservices decomposition, API gateway patterns, CQRS where it actually makes sense
- **Infrastructure** — Docker, Compose, reverse proxies, CI/CD pipelines, Linux server administration
- **Frontend when needed** — Angular with signals, standalone components, SSR — functional, not decorative

## Stack

- **Languages**: Java, TypeScript, SQL
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, NestJS, JPA/Hibernate
- **Frontend**: Angular, RxJS, Tailwind CSS
- **Infra**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Caddy, Linux (Arch btw)
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Current Focus

- Distributed systems patterns and failure modes
- Event-driven architecture
- Performance profiling and JVM tuning
- Making Angular SSR actually fast

## Outside of Work

I run Arch Linux as my daily driver. I read RFCs for fun sometimes. I care about tools that do one thing well.
